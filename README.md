# Titanic

Build a Machine Learning Model using Regression Analysis on Titanic dataset


## Dataset Information

In this challenge, we completed the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. This Dataset contains the information about Titanic ship and included 891Rows and 12 columns.In this notebook I try to find the best ML model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
